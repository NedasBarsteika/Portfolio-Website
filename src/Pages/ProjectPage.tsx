    description:
      "Collaborated with 3 other people towards making a video translator in around 60 hours. To explain our idea in simple terms, the user uploads a video to our website, selects a languge they want the video to be translated to and the website replaces the original spoken audio with the new audio in the selected language. With the help of hackathon's organizers, we were given temporary access to Chat GPT's AI and were able to use its' functions. In our project, we took advantage of its' 3 main features. To translate the voice in the original video, the program first transcripts the audio and transforms it into words. Secondly, the AI translates the text into the user's selected language. Thirdly, with the text to speech function, the AI is able to turn the translated text back into the voice format and replace the original sound of the video.",

    description:
      "Created an eCommerce type web application where the user can order products from an online shop. The backend is programmed in C# (ASP.NET Core) and the front-end is powered by Blazor (Bootstrap).  The program manages 2 SQL databases (listed products and orders from clients). Whenever a user orders a product, the Docker application runs the Kafka client, which manages microservices and lowers the total quantity of a product by the order quantity. The project is currently not fully complete. I plan to add user authentication, registration and signing in features, a seperate admin page to track all the orders, a cart page for the user that is logged in and a more professional check-out screen powered by Stripe.",
